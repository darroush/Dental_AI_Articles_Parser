TI  - Implementation of machine learning models as a quantitative evaluation tool for 
      preclinical studies in dental education.
LID - 10.1002/jdd.13722 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVE: Objective, valid, and reliable evaluations are needed in 
      order to develop haptic skills in dental education. The aim of this study is to 
      investigate the validity and reliability of the machine learning method in 
      evaluating the haptic skills of dentistry students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      One-hundred fifty 6th semester dental students have performed Class II amalgam 
      (C2A) and composite resin restorations (C2CR), in which all stages were evaluated 
      with Direct Observation Practical Skills forms. The final phase was graded by 
      three trainers and supervisors separately. Standard photographs of the 
      restorations in the final stage were taken from different angles in a special 
      setup and transferred to the Python program which utilized the Structural 
      Similarity algorithm to calculate both the quantitative (numerical) and 
      qualitative (visual) differences of each restoration. The validity and 
      reliability analyses of inter-examiner evaluation were tested by Cronbach's Alpha 
      and Kappa statistics (p = 0.05). RESULTS: The intra-examiner reliability between 
      Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) and examiners was found highly reliable in 
      both C2A (α = 0.961) and C2CR (α = 0.856). The compatibility of final grades 
      given by SSIM (53.07) and examiners (56.85) was statistically insignificant 
      (p > 0.05). A significant difference was found between the examiners and SSIM 
      when grading the occlusal surfaces in C2A and on the palatal surfaces of C2CR 
      (p < 0.05). The concordance of observer assessments was found almost perfect in 
      C2A (κ = 0.806), and acceptable in C2CR (κ = 0.769). CONCLUSION: Although deep 
      machine learning is a promising tool in the evaluation of haptic skills, further 
      improvement and alignments are required for fully objective and reliable 
      validation in all cases of dental training in restorative dentistry.

TI  - Can deep learning-designed anterior tooth-borne crown fulfill morphologic, 
      aesthetic, and functional criteria in clinical practice?

LID - 10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105368 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to compare the design outcomes of anterior crowns 
      generated using deep learning (DL)-based software with those fabricated by a 
      technician using conventional dental computer-assisted design (CAD) software 
      without DL support, with a focus on the evaluation of crown morphology, function, 
      and aesthetics. METHODS: Twenty-five in vivo datasets comprising maxillary and 
      mandibular arch scans of prepared maxillary central incisors were utilized to 
      design anterior crowns by using three methods: 1) a DL-based method resulting in 
      as-generated outcome (DB), 2) a DL-based method further optimized by a technician 
      (DM), and 3) a conventional CAD-based method (NC, control). Evaluations were 
      conducted for crown morphology (total discrepancy volume (TDV), root mean square 
      (RMS), positive average (PA) and negative average (NA) deviations), functional 
      aspects (incisal path: deviations, length, and mean inclination), and aesthetics 
      (crown width, height, width-to-height ratio, angular radius of mesioincisal line 
      angle, proximal contact length, and tooth axis angle). RESULTS: Significant 
      differences in TDV ratio were noted between the DB-NC (32.3 ±8.5%) and DM-NC 
      (26.5 ±5.4%) pairs (P = 0.006). No significant differences were observed in TDV 
      between the DB-NC (65.3 ±24.4 mm(3)) and DM-NC (54.3 ±21.0 mm(3)) pairs 
      (P = 0.095). For the entire palatal surface, significant differences in RMS and 
      PA values were observed between the DB-NC and DM-NC pairs (P < 0.037). 
      Significant differences in RMS values for the incisal half (P = 0.021) and in PA 
      values for the cervical half (P = 0.047) of the palatal surface were also noted 
      between these pairs. Significant differences in the deviation of the incisal path 
      were observed between the DB-NC (290.4 ±212.4 μm) and DM-NC (132.0 ±122.3 μm) 
      pairs (P<0.001). However, no significant differences were found among the groups 
      (DB, DM, and NC) in terms of the length and mean inclination of incisal paths or 
      in aesthetic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: A DL-based method can result in promising 
      outcomes with clinically acceptable morphology and aesthetics for anterior 
      crowns. Minor deviations in incisal path of the crowns may lead to anterior 
      guidance discrepancies, which can be corrected by the dental technician at the 
      design stage. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With the potential of DL-based design 
      methods in dental applications, integrating AI technology into dental CAD 
      workflow can enhance the clinical efficiency and consistency of anterior crown 
      design, although human intervention may be required to refine functional aspect.

TI  - Evaluation of Attitudes and Perceptions in Students About the Use of Artificial 
      Intelligence in Craniomaxillofacial Surgery.
LID - 10.1097/SCS.0000000000010687 [doi]
AB  - Developments in technology have created great changes in the field of medicine 
      and dentistry. Artificial intelligence technology is one of the most important 
      innovations that caused this change. This study aimed to evaluate the opinions of 
      dentistry students regarding the use of artificial intelligence in dentistry and 
      craniomaxillofacial surgery. Two hundred ninety-six dentistry students between 
      the ages of 19 and 30 participated in the study. Participants submitted the 
      survey by e-mail examining the student's opinions and attitudes regarding the use 
      of artificial intelligence in dentistry and craniomaxillofacial surgery. 
      Respondents' anonymity was ensured. 47.30% (n: 140) of the students participating 
      in the study are fourth-year students, and 52.70% (n: 156) are fifth-year 
      students. While 48.98% (n: 145) of the participants have knowledge about the uses 
      of artificial intelligence in daily life, 28.37% (n: 84) of the students have 
      knowledge about robotic surgery. While ~74% of the participants think that 
      artificial intelligence will improve the field of dentistry and 
      craniomaxillofacial surgery, it has been observed that they are not worried about 
      these applications replacing dentists in the future. It was determined that there 
      was no statistically significant difference between fourth-year and fifth-year 
      students in their knowledge levels about the areas of use of artificial 
      intelligence (P=0.548). Students' opinions show that 74% agree that artificial 
      intelligence will lead to major advances in the field of dentistry and 
      craniomaxillofacial surgery. This shows the relationship between dentists and 
      artificial intelligence points to a bright future.

TI  - Accuracy and consistency of ChatGPT-3.5 and - 4 in providing differential 
      diagnoses in oral and maxillofacial diseases: a comparative diagnostic 
      performance analysis.
PG  - 544
LID - 10.1007/s00784-024-05939-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the performance of ChatGPT in the differential 
      diagnosis of oral and maxillofacial diseases. METHODS: Thirty-seven oral and 
      maxillofacial lesions findings were presented to ChatGPT-3.5 and - 4, 18 dental 
      surgeons trained in oral medicine/pathology (OMP), 23 general dental 
      surgeons (DDS), and 16 dental students (DS) for differential diagnosis. 
      Additionally, a group of 15 general dentists was asked to describe 11 cases to 
      ChatGPT versions. The ChatGPT-3.5, -4, and human primary and alternative 
      diagnoses were rated by 2 independent investigators with a 4 Likert-Scale. The 
      consistency of ChatGPT-3.5 and - 4 was evaluated with regenerated inputs. 
      RESULTS: Moderate consistency of outputs was observed for ChatGPT-3.5 and - 4 to 
      provide primary (κ = 0.532 and κ = 0.533 respectively) and alternative (κ = 0.337 
      and κ = 0.367 respectively) hypotheses. The mean of correct diagnoses was 64.86% 
      for ChatGPT-3.5, 80.18% for ChatGPT-4, 86.64% for OMP, 24.32% for DDS, and 16.67% 
      for DS. The mean correct primary hypothesis rates were 45.95% for ChatGPT-3.5, 
      61.80% for ChatGPT-4, 82.28% for OMP, 22.72% for DDS, and 15.77% for DS. The mean 
      correct diagnosis rate for ChatGPT-3.5 with standard descriptions was 64.86%, 
      compared to 45.95% with participants' descriptions. For ChatGPT-4, the mean was 
      80.18% with standard descriptions and 61.80% with participant descriptions. 
      CONCLUSION: ChatGPT-4 demonstrates an accuracy comparable to specialists to 
      provide differential diagnosis for oral and maxillofacial diseases. Consistency 
      of ChatGPT to provide diagnostic hypotheses for oral diseases cases is moderate, 
      representing a weakness for clinical application. The quality of case 
      documentation and descriptions impacts significantly on the performance of 
      ChatGPT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: General dentists, dental students and specialists in 
      oral medicine and pathology may benefit from ChatGPT-4 as an auxiliary method to 
      define differential diagnosis for oral and maxillofacial lesions, but its 
      accuracy is dependent on precise case descriptions.

AB  - Artificial intelligence systems (AISs) gain relevance in dentistry, encompassing 
      diagnostics, treatment planning, patient management, and therapy. However, 
      questions about the generalizability, fairness, and transparency of these systems 
      remain. Regulatory and governance bodies worldwide are aiming to address these 
      questions using various frameworks. On March 13, 2024, members of the European 
      Parliament approved the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA), which emphasizes 
      trustworthiness and human-centeredness as relevant aspects to regulate AISs 
      beyond safety and efficacy. This review presents the AIA and similar regulatory 
      and governance efforts in other jurisdictions and lays out that regulations such 
      as the AIA are part of a complex ecosystem of interdependent and interwoven legal 
      requirements and standards. Current efforts to regulate dental AISs require 
      active input from the dental community, with participation of dental research, 
      education, providers, and patients being relevant to shape the future of dental 
      AISs.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) Assessment of Pediatric Dental Panoramic Radiographs 
      (DPRs): A Clinical Study.
PG  - 794-805
LID - 10.3390/pediatric16030067 [doi]
AB  - This clinical study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and 
      precision of artificial intelligence (AI) in assessing permanent teeth in 
      pediatric patients. Over one thousand consecutive DPRs taken in Kielce, Poland, 
      with the Carestream CS9600 device were screened. In the study material, 35 dental 
      panoramic radiographs (DPRs) of patients of developmental age were identified and 
      included. They were automatically evaluated with an AI algorithm. The DPRs were 
      then analyzed by researchers. The status of the following dichotomous variables 
      was assessed: (1) decay, (2) missing tooth, (3) filled tooth, (4) root canal 
      filling, and (5) endodontic lesion. The results showed high specificity and 
      accuracy (all above 85%) in detecting caries, dental fillings, and missing teeth 
      but low precision. This study provided a detailed assessment of AI performance in 
      a previously neglected age group. In conclusion, the overall accuracy of AI 
      algorithms for evaluating permanent dentition in dental panoramic radiographs is 
      lower for pediatric patients than adults or the entire population. Hence, 
      identifying primary teeth should be implemented in AI-driven software, at least 
      so as to ignore them when assessing mixed dentition (ClinicalTrials.gov 
      registration number: NCT06258798).

TI  - Enhanced Osteoporosis Detection Using Artificial Intelligence: A Deep Learning 
      Approach to Panoramic Radiographs with an Emphasis on the Mental Foramen.
LID - 10.3390/medsci12030049 [doi]
LID - 49
AB  - Osteoporosis, a skeletal disorder, is expected to affect 60% of women aged over 
      50 years. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans, the current gold 
      standard, are typically used post-fracture, highlighting the need for early 
      detection tools. Panoramic radiographs (PRs), common in annual dental 
      evaluations, have been explored for osteoporosis detection using deep learning, 
      but methodological flaws have cast doubt on otherwise optimistic results. This 
      study aims to develop a robust artificial intelligence (AI) application for 
      accurate osteoporosis identification in PRs, contributing to early and reliable 
      diagnostics. A total of 250 PRs from three groups (A: osteoporosis group, B: 
      non-osteoporosis group matching A in age and gender, C: non-osteoporosis group 
      differing from A in age and gender) were cropped to the mental foramen region. A 
      pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier was used for training, 
      testing, and validation with a random split of the dataset into subsets (A vs. B, 
      A vs. C). Detection accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. The 
      method achieved an F1 score of 0.74 and an AUC of 0.8401 (A vs. B). For young 
      patients (A vs. C), it performed with 98% accuracy and an AUC of 0.9812. This 
      study presents a proof-of-concept algorithm, demonstrating the potential of deep 
      learning to identify osteoporosis in dental radiographs. It also highlights the 
      importance of methodological rigor, as not all optimistic results are credible.

TI  - Smartphone-based scans of palate models of newborns with cleft lip and palate: 
      Outlooks for three-dimensional image capturing and machine learning plate tool.
LID - 10.1111/ocr.12859 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of smartphone scanning applications 
      (apps) in acquiring 3D meshes of cleft palate models. Secondarily, to validate a 
      machine learning (ML) tool for computing automated presurgical plate (PSP). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a comparative analysis of two apps on 15 
      cleft palate models: five unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), five bilateral 
      cleft lip and palate (BCLP) and five isolated cleft palate (ICP). The scans were 
      performed with and without a mirror to simulate intraoral acquisition. The 3D 
      reconstructions were compared to control reconstructions acquired using a 
      professional intraoral scanner using open-source software. RESULTS: Thirty 3D 
      scans were acquired by each app, totalling 60 scans. The main findings were in 
      the UCLP sample, where the KIRI scans without a mirror (0.22 ± 0.03 mm) had a 
      good performance with a deviation from the ground truth comparable to the control 
      group (0.14 ± 0.13 mm) (p = .653). Scaniverse scans with a mirror showed the 
      lowest accuracy of all the samples. The ML tool was able to predict the landmarks 
      and automatically generate the plates, except in ICP models. KIRI scans' plates 
      showed better performance with (0.22 ± 0.06 mm) and without mirror 
      (0.18 ± 0.05 mm), being comparable with controls (0.16 ± 0.08 mm) (p = .954 and 
      p = .439, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: KIRI Engine performed better in scanning 
      UCLP models without a mirror. The ML tool showed a high capability for morphology 
      recognition and automated PSP generation.

PG  - 534
LID - 10.1007/s00784-024-05921-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The selection of treatment for dental plaque is closely related to 
      the condition of the plaque on different teeth. This study validated the ability 
      of CNN models in assessing the dental plaque indices. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 
      70 (20 male and 50 female) healthy adults (18 to 55 years old), frontal and 
      lateral view intraoral images (210) of plaque disclosing agent stained permanent 
      and deciduous dentitions were obtained. A three-stage method was employed, where 
      the You Look Only Once version 8 (YOLOv8) model was first used to detect the 
      target teeth, followed by the prompt-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) 
      segmentation algorithm to segment teeth. A new single-tooth dataset consisting of 
      1400 photographs was obtained after applying a two-stage method. Finally, a 
      multi-class classification model DeepPlaq was trained and evaluated on the 
      accuracy of dental plaque indexing based on the Quigley-Hein Index (QHI) scoring 
      system. Classification performance was measured using accuracy, recall, 
      precision, and F1-score. RESULTS: The teeth detector exhibited an accuracy (mean 
      average precision, mAP) of approximately 0.941 ± 0.005 in identifying teeth with 
      plaque disclosing agents. The maximum accuracy attained in the plaque indexing 
      through DeepPlaq was 0.84 (probability that DeepPlaq scored identical to 
      experts), and the smallest average scoring error was less than 0.25 on a 0 to 5 
      scale for scoring. CONCLUSIONS: A three-stage approach demonstrated excellent 
      performance in detecting and segmenting target teeth, and DeepPlaq model also 
      showed strong performance in assessing dental plaque indices. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 
      Application of artificial intelligence to the evaluation of dental plaque 
      distribution could enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency and 
      accuracy.

TI  - Periodontitis diagnosis: A review of current and future trends in artificial 
      intelligence.
LID - 10.3233/THC-241169 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) acts as the state-of-the-art in 
      periodontitis diagnosis in dentistry. Current diagnostic challenges include 
      errors due to a lack of experienced dentists, limited time for radiograph 
      analysis, and mandatory reporting, impacting care quality, cost, and efficiency. 
      OBJECTIVE: This review aims to evaluate the current and future trends in AI for 
      diagnosing periodontitis. METHODS: A thorough literature review was conducted 
      following PRISMA guidelines. We searched databases including PubMed, Scopus, 
      Wiley Online Library, and ScienceDirect for studies published between January 
      2018 and December 2023. Keywords used in the search included "artificial 
      intelligence," "panoramic radiograph," "periodontitis," "periodontal disease," 
      and "diagnosis." RESULTS: The review included 12 studies from an initial 211 
      records. These studies used advanced models, particularly convolutional neural 
      networks (CNNs), demonstrating accuracy rates for periodontal bone loss detection 
      ranging from 0.76 to 0.98. Methodologies included deep learning hybrid methods, 
      automated identification systems, and machine learning classifiers, enhancing 
      diagnostic precision and efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating AI innovations in 
      periodontitis diagnosis enhances diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, providing a 
      robust alternative to conventional methods. These technologies offer quicker, 
      less labor-intensive, and more precise alternatives to classical approaches. 
      Future research should focus on improving AI model reliability and 
      generalizability to ensure widespread clinical adoption.

TI  - DentAge: Deep learning for automated age prediction using panoramic dental X-ray 
      images.
LID - 10.1111/1556-4029.15629 [doi]
AB  - Age estimation plays a crucial role in various fields, including forensic science 
      and anthropology. This study aims to develop and validate DentAge, a 
      deep-learning model for automated age prediction using panoramic dental X-ray 
      images. DentAge was trained on a dataset comprising 21,007 panoramic dental X-ray 
      images sourced from a private dental center in Slovenia. The dataset included 
      subjects aged 4 to 97 years with various dental conditions. Transfer learning was 
      employed, initializing the model with ImageNet weights and fine-tuning on the 
      dental image dataset. The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent 
      with momentum, and mean absolute error (MAE) served as the objective function. 
      Across the test dataset, DentAge achieved an MAE of 3.12 years, demonstrating its 
      efficacy in age prediction. Notably, the model performed well across different 
      age groups, with MAEs ranging from 1.94 (age group [10-20]) to 13.40 years (age 
      group [90-100]). Visual evaluation revealed factors contributing to prediction 
      errors, including prosthetic restorations, tooth loss, and bone resorption. 
      DentAge represents a significant advancement in automated age prediction within 
      dentistry. The model's robust performance across diverse age groups and dental 
      conditions underscores its potential utility in real-world scenarios. Our model 
      will be accessible to the public for further adjustments and validation, ensuring 
      DentAge's effectiveness and trustworthiness in practical scenarios.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This clinical study aimed to evaluate the practical value of 
      integrating an AI diagnostic model into clinical practice for caries detection 
      using intraoral images. METHODS: In this prospective study, 4,361 teeth from 191 
      consecutive patients visiting an endodontics clinic were examined using an 
      intraoral camera. The AI model, combining MobileNet-v3 and U-net architectures, 
      was used for caries detection. The diagnostic performance of the AI model was 
      assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), 
      negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, with the clinical diagnosis by 
      endodontic specialists as the reference standard. RESULTS: The overall accuracy 
      of the AI-assisted caries detection was 93.40%. The sensitivity and specificity 
      were 81.31% (95% CI 78.22%-84.06%) and 95.65% (95% CI 94.94%-96.26%), 
      respectively. The NPV and PPV were 96.49% (95% CI 95.84%-97.04%) and 77.68% (95% 
      CI 74.49%-80.58%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy varied depending on 
      tooth position and caries type, with the highest accuracy in anterior teeth 
      (96.04%) and the lowest sensitivity for interproximal caries in anterior teeth 
      and buccal caries in premolars (approximately 10%). CONCLUSION: The AI-assisted 
      caries detection tool demonstrated potential for clinical application, with high 
      overall accuracy and specificity. However, the sensitivity varied considerably 
      depending on tooth position and caries type, suggesting the need for further 
      improvement. Integration of multimodal data and development of more advanced AI 
      models may enhance the performance of AI-assisted caries detection in clinical 
      practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To achieve an accurate assessment of orthodontic and restorative 
      treatments, tooth segmentation of dental panoramic X-ray images is a critical 
      preliminary step, however, dental panoramic X-ray images suffer from poorly 
      defined interdental boundaries and low root-to-alveolar bone contrast, which pose 
      significant challenges to tooth segmentation. In this article, we propose a 
      multi-feature coordinate position learning-based tooth image segmentation method 
      for tooth segmentation. METHODS: For better analysis, the input image is randomly 
      flipped horizontally and vertically to enhance the data. Our method extracts 
      multi-scale tooth features from the designed residual omni-dimensional dynamic 
      convolution and the designed two-stream coordinate attention module can further 
      complement the tooth boundary features, and finally the two features are fused to 
      enhance the local details of the features and global contextual information, 
      which achieves the enrichment and optimization of the feature information. 
      RESULTS: The publicly available adult dental datasets Archive and Dataset and 
      Code were used in the study. The experimental results were 87.96% and 92.04% for 
      IoU, 97.79% and 97.32% for ACC, and 86.42% and 95.64% for Dice. CONCLUSION: The 
      experimental results show that the proposed network can be used to assist doctors 
      in quickly viewing tooth positions, and we also validate the effectiveness of the 
      proposed two modules in fusing features.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and analyse the influence of YouTube as 
      a learning modality for clinical procedures among medical and dental students in 
      a public-sector setting. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted at the 
      medical and dental constituent institutes of Jinnah Sindh Medical University and 
      Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre between August and October 2023, and comprised 
      undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students of either gender aged 18-40 
      years. Data was collected using a self-administered, structured, closed-ended 
      16-item questionnaire, which was developed in the English language and explored 
      the usage of YouTube as a source of information about medical and dental clinical 
      procedures. Data was coded and analysed using SPSS 26. RESULTS: Of the 314 
      participants, 153(48.7%) were medical students and 161(51.3%) were from the 
      dental stream, 175(55.7%) were females, and 139(44.3%) were males. YouTube was a 
      helpful tool for 143(45.5%) students who used it when needed, 172(54.8%) used it 
      occasionally before attempting procedures, while majority of the dental students 
      140(44.6%) used it to study for prosthodontics. There were 154(49%) students who 
      supported the idea that faculty should recommend watching relevant videos on 
      YouTube, while 256(81.5%) preferred other websites. CONCLUSION: YouTube was 
      mostly used for learning clinical procedures by the students.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare has the 
      potential to revolutionize the global healthcare sector and medicine in general. 
      However, integrating AI technologies in healthcare requires access to large 
      amounts of personal health-related data (HRD), which raises concerns regarding 
      confidential personal information considering unregulated and not transparent 
      data ownership. Setting up the patient's welfare as an unquestionable principle, 
      this commentary explores the various ethical aspects of using HRD in AI 
      applications, focusing on informed consent, data ownership, data sharing, 
      financial considerations, accountability, and ethical standards. Three models of 
      potential collaboration between AI-specializing firms and healthcare providers 
      are evaluated: the commercial model, the equitable profit-sharing model, and the 
      public-funded non-profit model. Each model has its advantages and challenges, 
      necessitating a careful balance between ethical considerations, financial 
      implications, and technological advancements. Policymakers and healthcare 
      regulators are urged to establish transparent legislation to safeguard patient 
      privacy, ensure informed consent, and promote the responsible use of HRD in AI 
      applications. This commentary emphasizes the importance of addressing ethical 
      issues to protect basic patient rights, foster responsible collaborations, and 
      ensure the ethical use of health-related data in AI-based healthcare 
      applications. While the coexistence of regulated AI and healthcare professionals 
      is inevitable for validating the cost-effectiveness of AI use in healthcare 
      economics, the transparency of HRD sources is deemed of utmost importance in the 
      best interest of the patient.

TI  - Validation of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Model for Early Childhood Caries 
      Detection in Dental Photographs.
LID - 10.3390/jcm13175215 [doi]
LID - 5215
AB  - Background/Objectives: Early childhood caries (ECC) is a widespread and severe 
      oral health problem that potentially affects the general health of children. 
      Visual-tactile examination remains the diagnostic method of choice to diagnose 
      ECC, although visual examination could be automated by artificial intelligence 
      (AI) tools in the future. The aim of this study was the external validation of a 
      recently published and freely accessible AI-based model for detecting ECC and 
      classifying carious lesions in dental photographs. Methods: A total of 143 
      anonymised photographs of anterior deciduous teeth (ECC = 107, controls = 36) 
      were visually evaluated by the dental study group (reference test) and analysed 
      using the AI-based model (test method). Diagnostic performance was determined 
      statistically. Results: ECC detection accuracy was 97.2%. Diagnostic performance 
      varied between carious lesion classes (noncavitated lesions, greyish 
      translucency/microcavity, cavitation, destructed tooth), with accuracies ranging 
      from 88.9% to 98.1%, sensitivities ranging from 68.8% to 98.5% and specificities 
      ranging from 86.1% to 99.4%. The area under the curve ranged from 0.834 to 0.964. 
      Conclusions: The performance of the AI-based model is similar to that reported 
      for the internal dataset used by developers. Further studies with independent 
      image samples are required to comprehensively gauge the performance of the model.

TI  - A Semi-Supervised Transformer-Based Deep Learning Framework for Automated Tooth 
      Segmentation and Identification on Panoramic Radiographs.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics14171948 [doi]
LID - 1948
AB  - Automated tooth segmentation and identification on dental radiographs are crucial 
      steps in establishing digital dental workflows. While deep learning networks have 
      been developed for these tasks, their performance has been inferior in partially 
      edentulous individuals. This study proposes a novel semi-supervised 
      Transformer-based framework (SemiTNet), specifically designed to improve tooth 
      segmentation and identification performance on panoramic radiographs, 
      particularly in partially edentulous cases, and establish an open-source dataset 
      to serve as a unified benchmark. A total of 16,317 panoramic radiographs (1589 
      labeled and 14,728 unlabeled images) were collected from various datasets to 
      create a large-scale dataset (TSI15k). The labeled images were divided into 
      training and test sets at a 7:1 ratio, while the unlabeled images were used for 
      semi-supervised learning. The SemiTNet was developed using a semi-supervised 
      learning method with a label-guided teacher-student knowledge distillation 
      strategy, incorporating a Transformer-based architecture. The performance of 
      SemiTNet was evaluated on the test set using the intersection over union (IoU), 
      Dice coefficient, precision, recall, and F1 score, and compared with five 
      state-of-the-art networks. Paired t-tests were performed to compare the 
      evaluation metrics between SemiTNet and the other networks. SemiTNet outperformed 
      other networks, achieving the highest accuracy for tooth segmentation and 
      identification, while requiring minimal model size. SemiTNet's performance was 
      near-perfect for fully dentate individuals (all metrics over 99.69%) and 
      excellent for partially edentulous individuals (all metrics over 93%). In 
      edentulous cases, SemiTNet obtained statistically significantly higher tooth 
      identification performance than all other networks. The proposed SemiTNet 
      outperformed previous high-complexity, state-of-the-art networks, particularly in 
      partially edentulous cases. The established open-source TSI15k dataset could 
      serve as a unified benchmark for future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent years have witnessed an explosive surge in dental research 
      related to artificial intelligence (AI). These applications have optimised dental 
      workflows, demonstrating significant clinical importance. Understanding the 
      current landscape and trends of this topic is crucial for both clinicians and 
      researchers to utilise and advance this technology. However, a comprehensive 
      scientometric study regarding this field had yet to be performed. METHODS: A 
      literature search was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database to 
      identify eligible "research articles" and "reviews." Literature screening and 
      exclusion were performed by 2 investigators. Thereafter, VOSviewer was utilised 
      in co-occurrence analysis and CiteSpace in co-citation analysis. R package 
      Bibliometrix was employed to automatically calculate scientific impacts, 
      determining the core authors and journals. Altmetric data were described 
      narratively and supplemented with Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: A total 
      of 1558 research publications were included. During the past 5 years, AI-related 
      dental publications drastically increased in number, from 36 to 581. Diagnostics 
      and Scientific Reports published the most articles, whereas Journal of Dental 
      Research received the highest number of citations per article. China, the US, and 
      South Korea emerged as the most prolific countries, whilst Germany received the 
      highest number of citations per article (23.29). Charité Universitätsmedizin 
      Berlin was the institution with the highest number of publications and citations 
      per article (29.16). Altmetric Attention Score was correlated with News Mentions 
      (P < .001), and significant associations were observed amongst Dimension 
      Citations, Mendeley Readers, and Web of Science Citations (P < .001). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The publication numbers regarding AI-related dental research have 
      been rising rapidly and may continue their upwards trend. China, the US, South 
      Korea, and Germany had promoted the progress of AI-related dental research. 
      Disease diagnosis, orthodontic applications, and morphology segmentation were 
      current hotspots. Attention mechanism, explainable AI, multimodal data fusion, 
      and AI-generated text assistants necessitate future research and exploration.

TI  - Human Tooth Crack Image Analysis with Multiple Deep Learning Approaches.
LID - 10.1007/s10439-024-03615-9 [doi]
AB  - Tooth cracks, one of the most common dental diseases, can result in the tooth 
      falling apart without prompt treatment; dentists also have difficulty locating 
      cracks, even with X-ray imaging. Indocyanine green (ICG) assisted near-infrared 
      fluorescence (NIRF) dental imaging technique can solve this problem due to the 
      deep penetration of NIR light and the excellent fluorescence characteristics of 
      ICG. This study extracted 593 human cracked tooth images and 601 non-cracked 
      tooth images from NIR imaging videos. Multiple imaging analysis methods such as 
      classification, object detection, and super-resolution were applied to the 
      dataset for cracked image analysis. Our results showed that machine learning 
      methods could help analyze tooth crack efficiently: the tooth images with cracks 
      and without cracks could be well classified with the pre-trained residual network 
      and squeezenet1_1 models, with a classification accuracy of 88.2% and 94.25%, 
      respectively; the single shot multi-box detector (SSD) was able to recognize 
      cracks, even if the input image was at a different size from the original cracked 
      image; the super-resolution (SR) model, SR-generative adversarial network 
      demonstrated enhanced resolution of crack images using high-resolution concrete 
      crack images as the training dataset. Overall, deep learning model-assisted human 
      crack analysis improves crack identification; the combination of our NIR dental 
      imaging system and deep learning models has the potential to assist dentists in 
      crack diagnosis.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies correlating occlusal morphology from 3-dimensional 
      intraoral scans with both soft and hard tissue dynamic landmark tracking within 
      the same participant population are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose of this 
      clinical study was to use 3-dimensional intraoral scanning, computer-aided 
      design, electrognathography, and artificial intelligence to investigate the 
      relationships between anterior occlusion and arch parameters with hard and soft 
      tissue displacements during speech production. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An 
      artificial intelligence (AI) driven software program and electrognathography was 
      used to record the phonetic activities in 62 participants for soft tissue (ST) 
      and hard tissue (HT) displacement. Soft tissue displacement was quantified by the 
      mean difference between subnasale and soft tissue pogonion peaks during phonetic 
      expressions, and hard tissue displacement was directly measured with an 
      electrognathograph. Intercanine and intermolar distances, arch perimeters, and 
      horizontal and vertical overlap were measured from the intraoral scan data. 
      RESULTS: ST and HT displacements were successfully estimated for fricative 
      (ST=7.16 ±4.51 mm, HT=11.86 ±4.02 mm), sibilant (ST=5.11 ±3.49 mm, HT=8.24 
      ±3.31 mm), linguodental (ST=5.72 ±4.46 mm, HT=10.01 ±3.16 mm), and bilabial 
      (ST=5.56 ±4.64 mm, HT=11.69 ±4.28 mm) phonetics. Vertical overlap correlated 
      positively with hard tissue movement during all speech expressions except 
      bilabial phonetics (ρ=.30 to.41, P<.05). Maxillary and mandibular arch perimeters 
      showed negative correlations with soft tissue displacement during linguodental 
      and bilabial speech (ρ=-.25 to -.41, P<.05) but were significantly correlated 
      with hard tissue movement during all speech assessments (ρ=-.28 to -.44, P<.05). 
      Maxillary intermolar distances negatively correlated with hard tissue phonetic 
      expressions (ρ=-.24 to -.30, P<.05). Participant age positively correlated with 
      soft tissue displacement during all speech patterns (ρ=.28 to.33, P<.05) and with 
      weight increase (ρ=.27, P=.033), and hard tissue displacement (ρ=.25, P=.048) 
      during maximum mouth opening significantly correlated with linguodental 
      phonetics. CONCLUSIONS: Within the study population, vertical overlap, maxillary 
      intermolar distance, and dental arch perimeters correlated significantly with 
      mandibular displacement during phonetic expression.

AB  - Camera image-based deep learning (DL) techniques have achieved promising results 
      in dental caries screening. To apply the intraoral camera image-based DL 
      technique for dental caries detection and assess its diagnostic performance, we 
      employed the ensemble technique in the image classification task. 2,682 intraoral 
      camera images were used as the dataset for image classification according to 
      dental caries presence and caries-lesion localization using DL models such as 
      ResNet-50, Inception-v3, Inception-ResNet-v2, and Faster R-convolutional neural 
      network according to diagnostic study design. 534 participants whose mean age 
      [SD] was 47.67 [±13.94] years were enrolled. The dataset was divided into 
      training (56.0%), validation (14.0%), and test subset (30.0%) annotated by one 
      experienced dentist as a reference standard about dental caries detection and 
      lesion location. The confusion matrix, area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve (AUROC), and average precision (AP) were evaluated for 
      performance analysis. In the end-to-end dental caries image classification, the 
      ensemble DL models had consistently improved performance, in which as the best 
      results, the ensemble model of Inception-ResNet-v2 achieved 0.94 of AUROC and 
      0.97 of AP. On the other hand, the explainable model achieved 0.91 of AUROC and 
      0.96 of AP after the ensemble application. For dental caries classification using 
      intraoral camera images, the application of ensemble techniques exhibited 
      consistently improved performance regardless of the DL models. Furthermore, the 
      trial to create an explainable DL model based on carious lesion detection yielded 
      favorable results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During preclinical training, dental students take radiographs of 
      acrylic (plastic) blocks containing extracted patient teeth. With the 
      digitisation of medical records, a central archiving system was created to store 
      and retrieve all x-ray images, regardless of whether they were images of teeth on 
      acrylic blocks, or those from patients. In the early stage of the digitisation 
      process, and due to the immaturity of the data management system, numerous images 
      were mixed up and stored in random locations within a unified archiving system, 
      including patient record files. Filtering out and expunging the undesired 
      training images is imperative as manual searching for such images is problematic. 
      Hence the aim of this stidy was to differentiate intraoral images from artificial 
      images on acrylic blocks. METHODS: An artificial intelligence (AI) solution to 
      automatically differentiate between intraoral radiographs taken of patients and 
      those taken of acrylic blocks was utilised in this study. The concept of transfer 
      learning was applied to a dataset provided by a Dental Hospital. RESULTS: An 
      accuracy score, F1 score, and a recall score of 98.8%, 99.2%, and 100%, 
      respectively, were achieved using a VGG16 pre-trained model. These results were 
      more sensitive compared to those obtained initally using a baseline model with 
      96.5%, 97.5%, and 98.9% accuracy score, F1 score, and a recall score 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed system using transfer learning was able 
      to accurately identify "fake" radiographs images and distinguish them from the 
      real intraoral images.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI) model in predicting soft 
      tissue and alveolar bone changes following orthodontic treatment and compare the 
      predictive performance of the AI model with conventional prediction models. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1774 lateral cephalograms of 887 adult patients 
      who had undergone orthodontic treatment were collected. Patients who had 
      orthognathic surgery were excluded. On each cephalogram, 78 landmarks were 
      detected using PIPNet-based AI. Prediction models consisted of 132 predictor 
      variables and 88 outcome variables. Predictor variables were demographics (age, 
      sex), clinical (treatment time, premolar extraction), and Cartesian coordinates 
      of the 64 anatomic landmarks. Outcome variables were Cartesian coordinates of the 
      22 soft tissue and 22 hard tissue landmarks after orthodontic treatment. The AI 
      prediction model was based on the TabNet deep neural network. Two conventional 
      statistical methods, multivariate multiple linear regression (MMLR) and partial 
      least squares regression (PLSR), were each implemented for comparison. Prediction 
      accuracy among the methods was compared. RESULTS: Overall, MMLR demonstrated the 
      most accurate results, while AI was least accurate. AI showed superior 
      predictions in only 5 of the 44 anatomic landmarks, all of which were soft tissue 
      landmarks inferior to menton to the terminal point of the neck. CONCLUSIONS: When 
      predicting changes following orthodontic treatment, AI was not as effective as 
      conventional statistical methods. However, AI had an outstanding advantage in 
      predicting soft tissue landmarks with substantial variability. Overall, results 
      may indicate the need for a hybrid prediction model that combines conventional 
      and AI methods.

      conventional linear regression methods?
PG  - 549-556
LID - 10.2319/111423-756.1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) model 
      in predicting orthognathic surgical outcomes compared to conventional prediction 
      methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative and posttreatment lateral 
      cephalograms from 705 patients who underwent combined surgical-orthodontic 
      treatment were collected. Predictors included 254 input variables, including 
      preoperative skeletal and soft-tissue characteristics, as well as the extent of 
      orthognathic surgical repositioning. Outcomes were 64 Cartesian coordinate 
      variables of 32 soft-tissue landmarks after surgery. Conventional prediction 
      models were built applying two linear regression methods: multivariate multiple 
      linear regression (MLR) and multivariate partial least squares algorithm (PLS). 
      The AI-based prediction model was based on the TabNet deep neural network. The 
      prediction accuracy was compared, and the influencing factors were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: In general, MLR demonstrated the poorest predictive performance. Among 
      32 soft-tissue landmarks, PLS showed more accurate prediction results in 16 
      soft-tissue landmarks above the upper lip, whereas AI outperformed in six 
      landmarks located in the lower border of the mandible and neck area. The 
      remaining 10 landmarks presented no significant difference between AI and PLS 
      prediction models. CONCLUSIONS: AI predictions did not always outperform 
      conventional methods. A combination of both methods may be more effective in 
      predicting orthognathic surgical outcomes.

TI  - Reliability of ChatGPT in automated essay scoring for dental undergraduate 
      examinations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to answer the research question: How reliable is 
      ChatGPT in automated essay scoring (AES) for oral and maxillofacial surgery (OMS) 
      examinations for dental undergraduate students compared to human assessors? 
      METHODS: Sixty-nine undergraduate dental students participated in a closed-book 
      examination comprising two essays at the National University of Singapore. Using 
      pre-created assessment rubrics, three assessors independently performed manual 
      essay scoring, while one separate assessor performed AES using ChatGPT (GPT-4). 
      Data analyses were performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and 
      Cronbach's α to evaluate the reliability and inter-rater agreement of the test 
      scores among all assessors. The mean scores of manual versus automated scoring 
      were evaluated for similarity and correlations. RESULTS: A strong correlation was 
      observed for Question 1 (r = 0.752-0.848, p < 0.001) and a moderate correlation 
      was observed between AES and all manual scorers for Question 2 (r = 0.527-0.571, 
      p < 0.001). Intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.794-0.858 indicated 
      excellent inter-rater agreement, and Cronbach's α of 0.881-0.932 indicated high 
      reliability. For Question 1, the mean AES scores were similar to those for manual 
      scoring (p > 0.05), and there was a strong correlation between AES and manual 
      scores (r = 0.829, p < 0.001). For Question 2, AES scores were significantly 
      lower than manual scores (p < 0.001), and there was a moderate correlation 
      between AES and manual scores (r = 0.599, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study 
      shows the potential of ChatGPT for essay marking. However, an appropriate rubric 
      design is essential for optimal reliability. With further validation, the ChatGPT 
      has the potential to aid students in self-assessment or large-scale marking 
      automated processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to evaluate the performance of a deep learning system 
      for the evaluation of tooth development stages on images obtained from panoramic 
      radiographs from child patients. METHODS: The study collected a total of 1500 
      images obtained from panoramic radiographs from child patients between the ages 
      of 5 and 14 years. YOLOv5, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object 
      detection model, was used to automatically detect the calcification states of 
      teeth. Images obtained from panoramic radiographs from child patients were 
      trained and tested in the YOLOv5 algorithm. True-positive (TP), false-positive 
      (FP), and false-negative (FN) ratios were calculated. A confusion matrix was used 
      to evaluate the performance of the model. RESULTS: Among the 146 test group 
      images with 1022 labels, there were 828 TPs, 308 FPs, and 1 FN. The sensitivity, 
      precision, and F1-score values of the detection model of the tooth stage 
      development model were 0.99, 0.72, and 0.84, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      conclusion, utilizing a deep learning-based approach for the detection of dental 
      development on pediatric panoramic radiographs may facilitate a precise 
      evaluation of the chronological correlation between tooth development stages and 
      age. This can help clinicians make treatment decisions and aid dentists in 
      finding more accurate treatment options.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In orthognatic surgery, one of the primary determinants for reliable 
      three-dimensional virtual surgery planning (3D VSP) and an accurate transfer of 
      3D VSP to the patient in the operation room is the condylar seating. Incorrectly 
      seated condyles would primarily affect the accuracy of maxillary-first 
      bimaxillary osteotomies as the maxillary repositioning is dependent on the 
      positioning of the mandible in the cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan. 
      This study aimed to develop and validate a novel tool by utilizing a deep 
      learning algorithm that automatically evaluates the condylar seating based on 
      CBCT images as a proof of concept. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As a reference, 60 CBCT 
      scans (120 condyles) were labeled. The automatic assessment of condylar seating 
      included three main parts: segmentation module, ray-casting, and feed-forward 
      neural network (FFNN). The AI-based algorithm was trained and tested using 
      fivefold cross validation. The method's performance was evaluated by comparing 
      the labeled ground truth with the model predictions on the validation dataset. 
      RESULTS: The model achieved an accuracy of 0.80, positive predictive value of 
      0.61, negative predictive value of 0.9 and F1-score of 0.71. The sensitivity and 
      specificity of the model was 0.86 and 0.78, respectively. The mean AUC over all 
      folds was 0.87. CONCLUSION: The innovative integration of multi-step 
      segmentation, ray-casting and a FFNN demonstrated to be a viable approach for 
      automating condylar seating assessment and have obtained encouraging results. 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Automated condylar seating assessment using deep learning may 
      improve orthognathic surgery, preventing errors and enhancing patient outcomes in 
      maxillary-first bimaxillary osteotomies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To support dentists with limited experience, this study trained and 
      compared six convolutional neural networks to detect crossbites and classify 
      non-crossbite, frontal, and lateral crossbites using 2D intraoral photographs. 
      METHODS: Based on 676 photographs from 311 orthodontic patients, six 
      convolutional neural network models were trained and compared to classify (1) 
      non-crossbite vs. crossbite and (2) non-crossbite vs. lateral crossbite vs. 
      frontal crossbite. The trained models comprised DenseNet, EfficientNet, 
      MobileNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, and Xception. FINDINGS: Among the models, Xception 
      showed the highest accuracy (98.57%) in the test dataset for classifying 
      non-crossbite vs. crossbite images. When additionally distinguishing between 
      lateral and frontal crossbites, average accuracy decreased with the DenseNet 
      architecture achieving the highest accuracy among the models with 91.43% in the 
      test dataset. CONCLUSIONS: Convolutional neural networks show high potential in 
      processing clinical photographs and detecting crossbites. This study provides 
      initial insights into how deep learning models can be used for orthodontic 
      diagnosis of malocclusions based on intraoral 2D photographs.

TI  - Application of digital workflow and technologies in clinical paediatric 
      dentistry: a scoping review.
LID - 10.1007/s40368-024-00936-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of the present scoping review is to map the literature 
      reporting on the application of digital workflows and digital technologies in the 
      diagnosis, treatment, or management of dental conditions in paediatric patients. 
      Furthermore, the review focuses on identifying possible knowledge gaps in the 
      area and developing specific recommendations for future investigations. METHODS: 
      An electronic search was performed on 3 databases up to July 2023. After the 
      authors independently screened the retrieved articles, they extracted the data 
      and assessed the risk of bias using the JBI (The Joanna Briggs Institute) 
      critical appraisal tools and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 tool, depending on the 
      study design assessed. RESULTS: After full-text assessment, 58 studies were 
      identified that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results were 
      divided into two groups according to the study design: 36 were research articles, 
      and 22 were case reports; only the research articles were included in the 
      qualitative synthesis. The most common topic was Scanners/3 d digital model 
      analysis (11 articles), followed by Digital Imaging (8 articles). Digital 
      applications were also a popular topic, and tele-dentistry and artificial 
      intelligence were also present in the included studies. CONCLUSION: Studies 
      investigating the use of digital workflows and digital technologies in the 
      diagnosis, treatment or management of dental conditions in paediatric dentistry 
      are lacking. In general, future investigations should be based on higher quality 
      studies; furthermore, the lack of studies on the clinical validation of digitally 
      fabricated orthodontic devices and restorations in paediatric patients provides 
      insights for future research.

AB  - Bone and cartilage tissues are physiologically dynamic organs that are 
      systematically regulated by mechanical inputs. At cellular level, mechanical 
      stimulation engages an intricate network where mechano-sensors and transmitters 
      cooperate to manipulate downstream signaling. Despite accumulating evidence, 
      there is a notable underutilization of available information, due to limited 
      integration and analysis. In this context, we conceived an interactive web tool 
      named MechanoBone to introduce a new avenue of literature-based discovery. 
      Initially, we compiled a literature database by sourcing content from Pubmed and 
      processing it through the Natural Language Toolkit project, Pubtator, and a 
      custom library. We identified direct co-occurrence among entities based on 
      existing evidence, archiving in a relational database via SQLite. Latent 
      connections were then quantified by leveraging the Link Prediction algorithm. 
      Secondly, mechanobiological pathway maps were generated, and an entity-pathway 
      correlation scoring system was established through weighted algorithm based on 
      our database, String, and KEGG, predicting potential functions of specific 
      entities. Additionally, we established a mechanical circumstance-based 
      exploration to sort genes by their relevance based on big data, revealing the 
      potential mechanically sensitive factors in bone research and future clinical 
      applications. In conclusion, MechanoBone enables: 1) interpreting 
      mechanobiological processes; 2) identifying correlations and crosstalk among 
      molecules and pathways under specific mechanical conditions; 3) connecting 
      clinical applications with mechanobiological processes in bone research. It 
      offers a literature mining tool with visualization and interactivity, 
      facilitating targeted molecule navigation and prediction within the 
      mechanobiological framework of bone-related cells, thereby enhancing knowledge 
      sharing and big data analysis in the biomedical realm.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In the treatment of malocclusion, continuous monitoring of the 
      three-dimensional relationship between dental roots and the surrounding alveolar 
      bone is essential for preventing complications from orthodontic procedures. 
      Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides detailed root and bone data, but 
      its high radiation dose limits its frequent use, consequently necessitating an 
      alternative for ongoing monitoring. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to develop a deep 
      learning-based cross-temporal multimodal image fusion system for acquiring root 
      and jawbone information without additional radiation, enhancing the ability of 
      orthodontists to monitor risk. METHODS: Utilizing CBCT and intraoral scans (IOSs) 
      as cross-temporal modalities, we integrated deep learning with multimodal fusion 
      technologies to develop a system that includes a CBCT segmentation model for 
      teeth and jawbones. This model incorporates a dynamic kernel prior model, 
      resolution restoration, and an IOS segmentation network optimized for dense point 
      clouds. Additionally, a coarse-to-fine registration module was developed. This 
      system facilitates the integration of IOS and CBCT images across varying spatial 
      and temporal dimensions, enabling the comprehensive reconstruction of root and 
      jawbone information throughout the orthodontic treatment process. RESULTS: The 
      experimental results demonstrate that our system not only maintains the original 
      high resolution but also delivers outstanding segmentation performance on 
      external testing datasets for CBCT and IOSs. CBCT achieved Dice coefficients of 
      94.1 % and 94.4 % for teeth and jawbones, respectively, and it achieved a Dice 
      coefficient of 91.7 % for the IOSs. Additionally, in the context of real-world 
      registration processes, the system achieved an average distance error (ADE) of 
      0.43 mm for teeth and 0.52 mm for jawbones, significantly reducing the processing 
      time. CONCLUSION: We developed the first deep learning-based cross-temporal 
      multimodal fusion system, addressing the critical challenge of continuous risk 
      monitoring in orthodontic treatments without additional radiation exposure. We 
      hope that this study will catalyze transformative advancements in risk management 
      strategies and treatment modalities, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of 
      future orthodontic practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH) is a localized, qualitative, 
      demarcated enamel defect that affects first permanent molars (FPMs) and/or 
      permanent incisors. The aim of present study was to introduce a novel 
      computerised assessment process to detect and quantify the percentage opacity 
      associated with MIH affected maxillary central incisors. METHODOLOGY: Children 
      (8-16 years) enrolled in the primary study having mild (white/cream or 
      yellow/brown) MIH lesion on fully erupted maxillary permanent central incisor. 50 
      standardised images of MIH lesions were captured in an artificially lit room with 
      fixed parameters and were anonymized and securely stored. Images were analysed by 
      AI-driven computerised software and generates output classifications via a 
      sophisticated algorithm crafted using a meticulously annotated image dataset as 
      reference through supervised machine learning (SML). For the validation of 
      computerised assessment of MIH lesions, the percentage of demarked opacity was 
      calculated using ADOBE PHOTOSHOP CS7. RESULTS: The percentage of MIH lesion was 
      calculated through histogram plotting with the maxima ranging from 7.29 % to 
      71.21 % with the mean value of 34.51 %. The validation score ranged from 10.29 % 
      to 67.27 % with the mean value of 35.32 %. The difference between the two was 
      statistically not significant. Out of 50 patients; 11 patients had 1-30 % of 
      surface affected with MIH and 2 had aesthetic concern; 24 had 30-60 % of surface 
      affected and 13 had aesthetic concern; 15 had >60 % of surface affected and 12 
      had aesthetic concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed approach exhibit sufficient 
      quality to be integrated into a dental software addressing practical challenges 
      encountered in daily clinical settings.

AB  - Rare genetic diseases are difficult to diagnose and this translates in patient's 
      diagnostic odyssey! This is particularly true for more than 900 rare diseases 
      including orodental developmental anomalies such as missing teeth. However, if 
      left untreated, their symptoms can become significant and disabling for the 
      patient. Early detection and rapid management are therefore essential in this 
      context. The i-Dent project aims to supply a pre-diagnostic tool to detect rare 
      diseases with tooth agenesis of varying severity and pattern. To identify missing 
      teeth, image segmentation models (Mask R-CNN, U-Net) have been trained for the 
      automatic detection of teeth on patients' panoramic dental X-rays. Teeth 
      segmentation enables the identification of teeth which are present or missing 
      within the mouth. Furthermore, a dental age assessment is conducted to verify 
      whether the absence of teeth is an anomaly or a characteristic of the patient's 
      age. Due to the small size of our dataset, we developed a new dental age 
      assessment technique based on the tooth eruption rate. Information about missing 
      teeth is then used by a final algorithm based on the agenesis probabilities to 
      propose a pre-diagnosis of a rare disease. The results obtained in detecting 
      three types of genes (PAX9, WNT10A and EDA) by our system are very promising, 
      providing a pre-diagnosis with an average accuracy of 72 %.

TI  - A questionnaire study regarding knowledge, attitude and usage of artificial 
      intelligence and machine learning by the orthodontic fraternity of Northern 
      India.
PG  - 500-506
LID - 10.1016/j.jobcr.2024.06.004 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the questionnaire study was to determine the knowledge, attitude, 
      and perception of orthodontists regarding the role of artificial intelligence in 
      dentistry in general and orthodontics specifically, and to determine the use of 
      artificial intelligence by the orthodontist. METHODS: This cross-sectional study 
      was done among the orthodontists of Northern India (clinicians, academicians, and 
      postgraduates) through a web-based electronic survey using Google Forms. The 
      study was designed to obtain information about AI and its basic usage in daily 
      life, in dentistry, and in orthodontics from the participants. The options given 
      were set specifically according to the Likert scale to maintain the correct 
      format. The questionnaire was validated by one AI expert and one orthodontic 
      expert, followed by pretesting in a smaller group of 25 orthodontists 2 weeks 
      before circulation. A total of 100 orthodontists and postgraduate students 
      responded to the pretested online questionnaire link for 31 questions in four 
      sections sent via social media websites in a period of 3 months. RESULTS: The 
      majority of the participants believe that AI could be useful in diagnosis and 
      treatment planning and could revolutionize dentistry in general. 84 % of the 
      orthodontic academicians and clinicians, including PG students, consider AI a 
      useful tool for boosting performance and delivering quality care in orthodontics, 
      and 72 % see AI as a partner rather than a competitor in the foreseeable future 
      of dentistry. 90 % of the participants believe that the incorporation of AI into 
      CBCT analysis can be a valuable addition to diagnosis and treatment planning. 
      86 % of total participants agree that AI can be helpful in decision-making for 
      orthognathic surgery, and 84 % find AI useful for bone age assessment. 
      CONCLUSIONS: It was observed that academicians are more aware of AI terminologies 
      and usage as compared to PG students and clinicians. There is a consensus that AI 
      is a useful tool for diagnosis and treatment planning, boosting performance and 
      quality care in orthodontics. In spite of these facts, 62.5 % of clinicians and 
      40 % of PG students are still not using AI for cephalometric analysis 
      (p = 0.033).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to address the critical gap of unavailability of 
      publicly accessible oral cavity image datasets for developing machine learning 
      (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for the diagnosis and 
      prognosis of oral cancer (OCA) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD), 
      with a particular focus on the high prevalence and delayed diagnosis in Asia. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following ethical approval and informed written consent, 
      images of the oral cavity were obtained from mobile phone cameras and clinical 
      data was extracted from hospital records from patients attending to the Dental 
      Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. After data management and hosting, 
      image categorization and annotations were done by clinicians using a custom-made 
      software tool developed by the research team. RESULTS: A dataset comprising 3000 
      high-quality, anonymized images obtained from 714 patients were classified into 
      four distinct categories: healthy, benign, OPMD, and OCA. Images were annotated 
      with polygonal shaped oral cavity and lesion boundaries. Each image is 
      accompanied by patient metadata, including age, sex, diagnosis, and risk factor 
      profiles such as smoking, alcohol, and betel chewing habits. CONCLUSION: 
      Researchers can utilize the annotated images in the COCO format, along with the 
      patients' metadata, to enhance ML and AI algorithm development.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This ex vivo diagnostic study aimed to externally validate an 
      open-access artificial intelligence (AI)-based model for the detection, 
      classification, localisation and segmentation of enamel/molar incisor 
      hypomineralisation (EH/MIH). METHODS: An independent sample of web images showing 
      teeth with (n = 277) and without (n = 178) EH/MIH was evaluated by a workgroup of 
      dentists whose consensus served as the reference standard. Then, an AI-based 
      model was used for the detection of EH/MIH, followed by automated classification 
      and segmentation of the findings (test method). The accuracy (ACC), sensitivity 
      (SE), specificity (SP) and area under the curve (AUC) were determined. 
      Furthermore, the correctness of EH/MIH lesion localisation and segmentation was 
      evaluated. RESULTS: An overall ACC of 94.3 % was achieved for image-based 
      detection of EH/MIH. Cross-classification of the AI-based class prediction and 
      the reference standard resulted in an agreement of 89.2 % for all diagnostic 
      decisions (n = 594), with an ACC between 91.4 % and 97.8 %. The corresponding SE 
      and SP values ranged from 81.7 % to 92.8 % and 91.9 % to 98.7 %, respectively. 
      The AUC varied between 0.894 and 0.945. Image size had only a limited impact on 
      diagnostic performance. The AI-based model correctly predicted EH/MIH 
      localisation in 97.3 % of cases. For the detected lesions, segmentation was fully 
      correct in 63.4 % of all cases and partially correct in 33.9 %. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study documented the promising diagnostic performance of an open-access AI tool 
      in the detection and classification of EH/MIH in external images. CLINICAL 
      SIGNIFICANCE: Externally validated AI-based diagnostic methods could facilitate 
      the detection of EH/MIH lesions in dental photographs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The accuracy of tooth segmentation in intraoral scans is crucial 
      for performing virtual setups and appliance fabrication. Hence, the objective of 
      this study was to estimate and compare the accuracy of automated tooth 
      segmentation generated by the artificial intelligence of dentOne software (DIORCO 
      Co, Ltd, Yongin, South Korea) and Medit Ortho Simulation software (Medit Corp, 
      Seoul, South Korea). METHODS: Twelve maxillary and mandibular pretreatment dental 
      scan sets comprising 286 teeth were collected for this investigation from the 
      archives of the Department of Orthodontics, Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria 
      University. The scans were imported as standard tessellation language files into 
      both dentOne and Medit Ortho Simulation software. Automatic segmentation was run 
      on each software. The number of successfully segmented teeth vs failed 
      segmentations was recorded to determine the success rate of automated 
      segmentation of each program. Evaluation of success and/or failure was based on 
      the software's identification of the teeth and the quality of the segmentation. 
      The mesiodistal tooth width measurements after segmentation using both tested 
      software programs were compared with those measured on the unsegmented scan using 
      Meshmixer software (Autodesk, San Rafael, Calif). The unsegmented scans served as 
      the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 288 teeth were examined. Successful 
      identification rates were 99% and 98.3% for Medit and dentOne, respectively. 
      Success rates of segmenting the lingual surfaces of incisors were significantly 
      higher in Medit than in dentOne (93.7% vs 66.7%, respectively; P <0.001). DentOne 
      overestimated the mesiodistal width of canines (0.11 mm, P = 0.032), premolars 
      (0.22 mm, P < 0.001), and molars (0.14 mm, P = 0.043) compared with the reference 
      standard, whereas Medit overestimated the mesiodistal width of premolars only 
      (0.13 mm, P = 0.006). Bland-Altman plots showed that mesiodistal tooth width 
      agreement limits exceeded 0.2 mm between each software and the reference 
      standard. CONCLUSIONS: Both artificial intelligence-segmentation software 
      demonstrated acceptable accuracy in tooth segmentation. There is a need for 
      improvement in segmenting incisor lingual tooth surfaces in dentOne. Both 
      software programs tended to overestimate the mesiodistal widths of segmented 
      teeth, particularly the premolars. Artificial intelligence-segmentation needs to 
      be manually adjusted by the operator to ensure accuracy. However, this still does 
      not solve the problem of proximal surface reconstruction by the software.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if supervised machine learning 
      algorithms can accurately predict voided computerized physician order entry in 
      oral and maxillofacial surgery inpatients. METHODS: Data from Electronic Medical 
      Record included patient demographics, comorbidities, procedures, vital signs, 
      laboratory values, and medication orders were retrospectively collected. 
      Predictor variables included patient demographics, comorbidities, procedures, 
      vital signs, and laboratory values. Outcome of interest is if a medication order 
      was voided or not. Data was cleaned and processed using Microsoft Excel and 
      Python v3.12. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, 
      and Naïve Bayes were trained, validated, and tested for accuracy of the 
      prediction of voided medication orders. RESULTS: 37,493 medication orders from 
      1,204 patient admissions over 5 years were used for this study. 3,892 (10.4%) 
      medication orders were voided. Gradient Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forest, 
      K-Nearest Neighbor, and Naïve Bayes had an Area Under the Receiver Operating 
      Curve of 0.802 with 95% CI [0.787, 0.825], 0.746 with 95% CI [0.722, 0.765], 
      0.685 with 95% CI [0.667, 0.699], and 0.505 with 95% CI [0.489, 0.539], 
      respectively. Area Under the Precision Recall Curve was 0.684 with 95% CI [0.679, 
      0.702], 0.647 with 95% CI [0.638, 0.664], 0.429 with 95% CI [0.417, 0.434], and 
      0.551 with 95% CI [0.551, 0.552], respectively. CONCLUSION: Gradient Boosted 
      Decision Trees was the best performing model of the supervised machine learning 
      algorithms with satisfactory outcomes in the test cohort for predicting voided 
      Computerized Physician Order Entry in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery inpatients.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aims to develop a deep learning framework for the automatic 
      detection of the position relationship between the mandibular third molar (M3) 
      and the mandibular canal (MC) on panoramic radiographs (PRs), to assist doctors 
      in assessing and planning appropriate surgical interventions. METHODS: Datasets 
      D1 and D2 were obtained by collecting 253 PRs from a hospitals and 197 PRs from 
      online platforms. The RPIFormer model proposed in this study was trained and 
      validated on D1 to create a segmentation model. The CycleGAN model was trained 
      and validated on both D1 and D2 to develop an image enhancement model. 
      Ultimately, the segmentation and enhancement models were integrated with an 
      object detection model to create a fully automated framework for M3 and MC 
      detection in PRs. Experimental evaluation included calculating Dice coefficient, 
      IoU, Recall, and Precision during the process. RESULTS: The RPIFormer model 
      proposed in this study achieved an average Dice coefficient of 92.56 % for 
      segmenting M3 and MC, representing a 3.06 % improvement over the previous best 
      study. The deep learning framework developed in this research enables automatic 
      detection of M3 and MC in PRs without manual cropping, demonstrating superior 
      detection accuracy and generalization capability. CONCLUSION: The framework 
      developed in this study can be applied to PRs captured in different hospitals 
      without the need for model fine-tuning. This feature is significant for aiding 
      doctors in accurately assessing the spatial relationship between M3 and MC, 
      thereby determining the optimal treatment plan to ensure patients' oral health 
      and surgical safety.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In dental clinical practice, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) 
      is commonly used to assist practitioners to recognize the complex morphology of 
      root canal systems; however, because of its resolution limitations, certain small 
      anatomical structures still cannot be accurately recognized on CBCT. The purpose 
      of this study was to perform image super-resolution (SR) processing on CBCT 
      images of extracted human teeth with the help of a deep learning model, and to 
      compare the differences among CBCT, super-resolution computed tomography (SRCT), 
      and micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) images through three-dimensional 
      reconstruction. METHODS: The deep learning model (Basicvsr++) was selected and 
      modified. The dataset consisted of 171 extracted teeth that met inclusion 
      criteria, with 40 maxillary first molars as the training set and 40 maxillary 
      first molars as well as 91 teeth from other tooth positions as the external test 
      set. The corresponding CBCT, SRCT, and Micro-CT images of each tooth in test sets 
      were reconstructed using Mimics Research 17.0, and the root canal recognition 
      rates in the 3 groups were recorded. The following parameters were measured: 
      volume of hard tissue (V1), volume of pulp chamber and root canal system (V2), 
      length of visible root canals under orifice (VL-X, where X represents the 
      specific root canal), and intersection angle between coronal axis of canal and 
      long axis of tooth (∠X, where X represents the specific root canal). Data were 
      statistically analyzed between CBCT and SRCT images using paired sample t-test 
      and Wilcoxon test analysis, with the measurement from Micro-CT images as the gold 
      standard. RESULTS: Images from all tested teeth were successfully processed with 
      the SR program. In 4-canal maxillary first molar, identification of MB2 was 72% 
      (18/25) in CBCT group, 92% (23/25) in SRCT group, and 100% (25/25) in Micro-CT 
      group. The difference of hard tissue volume between SRCT and Micro-CT was 
      significantly smaller than that between CBCT and Micro-CT in all tested teeth 
      except 4-canal mandibular first molar (P < .05). Similar results were obtained in 
      volume of pulp chamber and root canal system in all tested teeth (P < .05). As 
      for length of visible root canals under orifice, the difference between SRCT and 
      Micro-CT was significantly smaller than that between CBCT and Micro-CT (P < .05) 
      in most root canals. CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning model developed in this study 
      helps to optimize the root canal morphology of extracted teeth in CBCT. And it 
      may be helpful for the identification of MB2 in the maxillary first molar.

TI  - How well do large language model-based chatbots perform in oral and maxillofacial 
      radiology?
PG  - 390-395
LID - 10.1093/dmfr/twae021 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the performance of four large language model 
      (LLM)-based chatbots by comparing their test results with those of dental 
      students on an oral and maxillofacial radiology examination. METHODS: ChatGPT, 
      ChatGPT Plus, Bard, and Bing Chat were tested on 52 questions from regular dental 
      college examinations. These questions were categorized into three educational 
      content areas: basic knowledge, imaging and equipment, and image interpretation. 
      They were also classified as multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and short-answer 
      questions (SAQs). The accuracy rates of the chatbots were compared with the 
      performance of students, and further analysis was conducted based on the 
      educational content and question type. RESULTS: The students' overall accuracy 
      rate was 81.2%, while that of the chatbots varied: 50.0% for ChatGPT, 65.4% for 
      ChatGPT Plus, 50.0% for Bard, and 63.5% for Bing Chat. ChatGPT Plus achieved a 
      higher accuracy rate for basic knowledge than the students (93.8% vs. 78.7%). 
      However, all chatbots performed poorly in image interpretation, with accuracy 
      rates below 35.0%. All chatbots scored less than 60.0% on MCQs, but performed 
      better on SAQs. CONCLUSIONS: The performance of chatbots in oral and 
      maxillofacial radiology was unsatisfactory. Further training using specific, 
      relevant data derived solely from reliable sources is required. Additionally, the 
      validity of these chatbots' responses must be meticulously verified.

TI  - Identification of Root Canal Morphology in Fused-rooted Mandibular Second Molars 
      From X-ray Images Based on Deep Learning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Understanding the intricate anatomical morphology of fused-rooted 
      mandibular second molars (MSMs) is essential for root canal treatment. The 
      present study utilized a deep learning approach to identify the three-dimensional 
      root canal morphology of MSMs from two-dimensional X-ray images. METHODS: A total 
      of 271 fused-rooted MSMs were included in the study. Micro-computed tomography 
      reconstruction images and two-dimensional X-ray projection images were obtained. 
      The ground truth of three-dimensional root canal morphology was determined 
      through micro-computed tomography images, which were classified into merging, 
      symmetrical, and asymmetrical types. To amplify the X-ray image dataset, 
      traditional augmentation techniques from the python package Augmentor and a 
      multiangle projection method were employed. Identification of root canal 
      morphology was conducted using the pretrained VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet50, and 
      EfficientNet-b5 on X-ray images. The classification results from convolutional 
      neural networks (CNNs) were then compared with those performed by endodontic 
      residents. RESULTS: The multiangle projection augmentation method outperformed 
      the traditional approach in all CNNs except for EfficientNet-b5. ResNet18 
      combined with the multiangle projection method outperformed all other 
      combinations, with an overall accuracy of 79.25%. In specific classifications, 
      accuracies of 81.13%, 86.79%, and 90.57% were achieved for merging, symmetrical, 
      and asymmetrical types, respectively. Notably, CNNs surpassed endodontic 
      residents in classification performance; the average accuracy for endodontic 
      residents was only 60.38% (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: CNNs were more effective than 
      endodontic residents in identifying the three-dimensional root canal morphology 
      of MSMs. The result indicates that CNNs possess the capacity to employ 
      two-dimensional images effectively in aiding three-dimensional diagnoses.

TI  - Conquering class imbalances in deep learning-based segmentation of dental 
      radiographs with different loss functions.

LID - S0300-5712(24)00232-X [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The imbalanced nature of real-world datasets is an ongoing challenge 
      in the field of machine and deep learning. In medicine and in dentistry, most 
      data samples represent patients not affected by pathologies, and on imagery, 
      pathologic image areas are often smaller than healthy ones. Selecting suitable 
      loss functions during deep learning is essential and may help to overcome the 
      resulting imbalance. We assessed six different loss functions for one exemplary 
      task, tooth structure segmentation on bitewing radiographs, for their 
      performance. METHODS: Six different loss functions (Focal Loss, Dice Loss, 
      Tversky Loss and hybrid losses of Cross-Entropy and Dice Loss, Focal and Dice 
      Loss, Focal and Generalized Dice Loss) were compared on a tooth structure 
      segmentation task of 1,625 bitewing radiographs. Training was performed using 
      three different model architectures (U-Net, Linknet, DeepLavbV3+) over a 5-fold 
      cross-validation. Tooth structures consisted of the classes (occurrence in% of 
      samples/captures areas measured on pixel level) enamel (100 %/25 %), dentin (100 
      %/50 %), root canal (100 %/10 %), filling (81 %/8 %) and crown (28 %/5 %). 
      RESULTS: Hybrid loss functions significantly outperformed standalone ones and 
      provided robust results over the different architectures for the classes enamel, 
      dentin, root canal and filling. Specifically, the Dice Focal loss reached high 
      performance to conquer both image level and pixel level class imbalance, 
      respectively. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: In dental use cases it is often important to 
      predict minority classes such as pathologies accurately. Using specific loss 
      function may be an effective strategy to overcome data imbalance when training 
      deep learning models.

TI  - Changes in Perceived Emotions in Facial Paralysis Patients After Depressor Anguli 
      Oris Excision.
PG  - 4028-4035
LID - 10.1002/lary.31471 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depressor anguli oris (DAO) excision can improve clinician-graded, 
      objective, and patient-reported smile outcomes in patients with nonflaccid facial 
      paralysis (NFFP). However, no prior research has studied changes in perceived 
      emotions after surgery. This study quantifies changes in perceived emotions with 
      smiling after DAO excision in the largest case series presented to date. METHODS: 
      Prospectively collected data from patients with NFFP who underwent DAO excision 
      at a tertiary care facial nerve center were reviewed. Patient-reported, 
      clinician-graded, and objective smile metrics were compared before and after 
      surgery. Videos of faces at rest and while smiling were analyzed by artificial 
      intelligence-derived facial expression analysis software to quantify perceived 
      emotions. RESULTS: Sixty-eight patients underwent isolated DAO excision between 
      August 2021 and August 2023. Patients conveyed significantly more perceived 
      happiness with smile and at rest after surgery (p < 0.001 and p = 0.012, 
      respectively). DAO excision improved oral commissure excursion (p < 0.001), 
      dental show (p < 0.001), and smile angle (p < 0.001) symmetry. Patients reported 
      significant improvements in smiling and social function after surgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates DAO excision increases perceived happiness 
      conveyed by patients with NFFP while smiling and at rest. It confirms improved 
      objective, clinician-graded, and patient-reported smile outcomes after surgery.

LID - 10.1109/TBME.2024.3392537 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Wearable devices are developed to measure head impact kinematics but 
      are intrinsically noisy because of the imperfect interface with human bodies. 
      This study aimed to improve the head impact kinematics measurements obtained from 
      instrumented mouthguards using deep learning to enhance traumatic brain injury 
      (TBI) risk monitoring. METHODS: We developed one-dimensional convolutional neural 
      network (1D-CNN) models to denoise mouthguard kinematics measurements for 
      tri-axial linear acceleration and tri-axial angular velocity from 163 laboratory 
      dummy head impacts. The performance of the denoising models was evaluated on 
      three levels: kinematics, brain injury criteria, and tissue-level strain and 
      strain rate. Additionally, we performed a blind test on an on-field dataset of 
      118 college football impacts and a test on 413 post-mortem human subject (PMHS) 
      impacts. RESULTS: On the dummy head impacts, the denoised kinematics showed 
      better correlation with reference kinematics, with relative reductions of 36% for 
      pointwise root mean squared error and 56% for peak absolute error. Absolute 
      errors in six brain injury criteria were reduced by a mean of 82%. For maximum 
      principal strain and maximum principal strain rate, the mean error reduction was 
      35% and 69%, respectively. On the PMHS impacts, similar denoising effects were 
      observed and the peak kinematics after denoising were more accurate (relative 
      error reduction for 10% noisiest impacts was 75.6%). CONCLUSION: The 1D-CNN 
      denoising models effectively reduced errors in mouthguard-derived kinematics 
      measurements on dummy and PMHS impacts. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides a novel 
      approach for denoising head kinematics measurements in dummy and PMHS impacts, 
      which can be further validated on more real-human kinematics data before 
      real-world applications.

TI  - Detection and classification of mandibular fractures in panoramic radiography 
      using artificial intelligence.
PG  - 363-371
LID - 10.1093/dmfr/twae018 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated the performance of the YOLOv5 deep learning 
      model in detecting different mandibular fracture types in panoramic images. 
      METHODS: The dataset of panoramic radiographs with mandibular fractures was 
      divided into training, validation, and testing sets, with 60%, 20%, and 20% of 
      the images, respectively. An equal number of control images without fractures 
      were also distributed among the datasets. The YOLOv5 algorithm was trained to 
      detect six mandibular fracture types based on the anatomical location including 
      symphysis, body, angle, ramus, condylar neck, and condylar head. Performance 
      metrics of accuracy, precision, sensitivity (recall), specificity, dice 
      coefficient (F1 score), and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for each 
      class. RESULTS: A total of 498 panoramic images containing 673 fractures were 
      collected. The accuracy was highest in detecting body (96.21%) and symphysis 
      (95.87%), and was lowest in angle (90.51%) fractures. The highest and lowest 
      precision values were observed in detecting symphysis (95.45%) and condylar head 
      (63.16%) fractures, respectively. The sensitivity was highest in the body 
      (96.67%) fractures and was lowest in the condylar head (80.00%) and condylar neck 
      (81.25%) fractures. The highest specificity was noted in symphysis (98.96%), body 
      (96.08%), and ramus (96.04%) fractures, respectively. The dice coefficient and 
      AUC were highest in detecting body fractures (0.921 and 0.942, respectively), and 
      were lowest in detecting condylar head fractures (0.706 and 0.812, respectively). 
      CONCLUSION: The trained algorithm achieved promising results in detecting most 
      fracture types, particularly in body and symphysis regions indicating machine 
      learning potential as a diagnostic aid for clinicians.

TI  - Artificial neural networks reconstruct missing perikymata in worn teeth.
PG  - 3120-3138
LID - 10.1002/ar.25416 [doi]
AB  - Dental evolutionary studies in hominins are key to understanding how our 
      ancestors and close fossil relatives grew from the early stages of embryogenesis 
      into adults. In a sense, teeth are like an airplane's 'black box' as they record 
      important variables for assessing developmental timing, enabling comparisons 
      within and between populations, species, and genera. The ability to discern this 
      type of nuanced information is embedded in the nature of how tooth enamel and 
      dentin form: incrementally and over years. This incremental growth leaves 
      chronological indicators in the histological structure of enamel, visible on the 
      crown surface as perikymata. These structures are used in the process of 
      reconstructing the rate and timing of tooth formation. Unfortunately, the 
      developmentally earliest growth lines in lateral enamel are quickly lost to wear 
      once the tooth crown erupts. We developed a method to reconstruct these earliest, 
      missing perilymata from worn teeth through knowledge of the later-developed, 
      visible perikymata for all tooth types (incisors, canines, premolars, and molars) 
      using a modern human dataset. Building on our previous research using polynomial 
      regressions, here we describe an artificial neural networks (ANN) method. This 
      new ANN method mostly predicts within 2 counts the number of perikymata present 
      in each of the first three deciles of the crown height for all tooth types. Our 
      ANN method for estimating perikymata lost through wear has two immediate 
      benefits: more accurate values can be produced and worn teeth can be included in 
      dental research. This tool is available on the open-source platform R within the 
      package teethR released under GPL v3.0 license, enabling other researchers the 
      opportunity to expand their datasets for studies of periodicity in histological 
      growth, dental development, and evolution.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In cases where the brands of implants are not known, treatment options 
      can be significantly limited in potential complications arising from implant 
      procedures. This research aims to explore the application of deep learning 
      techniques for the classification of dental implant systems using panoramic 
      radiographs. The primary objective is to assess the superiority of the proposed 
      model in achieving accurate and efficient dental implant classification. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted using a diverse set of 25 
      convolutional neural network (CNN) models, including popular architectures such 
      as VGG16, ResNet-50, EfficientNet, and ConvNeXt. The dataset of 1258 panoramic 
      radiographs from patients who underwent implant treatment at faculty of dentistry 
      was utilized for training and evaluation. Six different dental implant systems 
      were employed as prototypes for the classification task. The precision, recall, 
      F1 score, and support scores for each class have included in the classification 
      accuracy report to ensure accurate and reliable results from the model. RESULTS: 
      The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently 
      outperformed the other evaluated CNN architectures in terms of accuracy, 
      precision, recall, and F1-score. With an impressive accuracy of 95.74 % and high 
      precision and recall rates, the ConvNeXt model showcased its superiority in 
      accurately classifying dental implant systems. Notably, the model's performance 
      was achieved with a relatively smaller number of parameters, indicating its 
      efficiency and speed during inference. CONCLUSION: The findings highlight the 
      effectiveness of deep learning techniques, particularly the proposed model, in 
      accurately classifying dental implant systems from panoramic radiographs.

AB  - The permanent left mandibular canines have been used for sexual dimorphism when 
      human identification is necessary. Controversy remains whether the morphology of 
      these teeth is actually useful to distinguish males and females. This study aimed 
      to assess the sexual dimorphism of canines by means of a pioneering artificial 
      intelligence approach to this end. A sample of 13,046 teeth radiographically 
      registered from 5838 males and 7208 females between the ages of 6 and 22.99 years 
      was collected. The images were annotated using Darwin V7 software. DenseNet121 
      was used and tested based on binary answers regarding the sex (male or female) of 
      the individuals for 17 age categories of one year each (i.e. 6-6.99, 7.7.99… 
      22.22.99). Accuracy rates, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and 
      confusion matrices were used to quantify and express the artificial 
      intelligence's classification performance. The accuracy rates across age 
      categories were between 57-76% (mean: 68%±5%). The area under the curve (AUC) of 
      the ROC analysis was between 0.58 and 0.77. The best performances were observed 
      around the age of 12 years, while the worst were around the age of 7 years. The 
      morphological analysis of canines for sex estimation should be restricted and 
      allowed in practice only when other sources of dimorphic anatomic features are 
      not available.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine if a deep learning (DL) model 
      can predict the surgical difficulty for impacted maxillary third molar tooth 
      using panoramic images before surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The dataset 
      consists of 708 panoramic radiographs of the patients who applied to the Oral and 
      Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic for various reasons. Each maxillary third molar 
      difficulty was scored based on dept (V), angulation (H), relation with maxillary 
      sinus (S), and relation with ramus (R) on panoramic images. The YoloV5x 
      architecture was used to perform automatic segmentation and classification. To 
      prevent re-testing of images, participate in the training, the data set was 
      subdivided as: 80 % training, 10 % validation, and 10 % test group. RESULTS: 
      Impacted Upper Third Molar Segmentation model showed best success on sensitivity, 
      precision and F1 score with 0,9705, 0,9428 and 0,9565, respectively. S-model had 
      a lesser sensitivity, precision and F1 score than the other models with 0,8974, 
      0,6194, 0,7329, respectively. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the proposed DL 
      model could be effective for predicting the surgical difficulty of an impacted 
      maxillary third molar tooth using panoramic radiographs and this approach might 
      help as a decision support mechanism for the clinicians in peri‑surgical period.
