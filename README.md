# Automated Dental AI Research Abstract Processor

This project automates the retrieval, processing, and summarization of research abstracts related to AI in Dentistry. It pulls research papers from PubMed, processes each abstract using OpenAI’s GPT model to extract structured insights, and generates a Word document summarizing each paper. This is especially helpful for researchers looking to gather up-to-date information on AI applications in dentistry.

## Features

- **PubMed Data Retrieval**: Automatically fetches research articles from PubMed using customizable search criteria.
- **Automated Abstract Processing**: Uses OpenAI’s GPT model to analyze abstracts and extract key insights such as study objectives, model architecture, and performance metrics.
- **Word Document Summary**: Generates an A3 landscape-formatted Word document that provides a structured summary of each research paper in a table format.

### File Descriptions

#### `process_research_papers.py`

This main script performs the following:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Loads OpenAI API key from environment variables.
   - Defines the PubMed search query for AI-related dental research within a specified time interval.
   
2. **Data Fetching**:
   - Calls `fetch_pubmed_data()` from `helper.py` to retrieve up to 100 articles from PubMed.

3. **Processing Abstracts**:
   - Loops through each abstract in the Excel file generated by `pubmed_parser` and uses OpenAI’s GPT model to extract structured insights:
     - **Objectives**: Aim of the study.
     - **Study Type**: Classification, segmentation, detection, etc.
     - **Data Type**: Data specifics (e.g., "1300 panoramic radiographs").
     - **Model Architecture**: AI model used, like CNN or SVM.
     - **Metrics**: Key performance indicators, such as IoU or F1 score.
     - **Conclusion**: Main findings.

4. **Document Creation**:
   - Generates an A3 landscape-oriented Word document and inserts a summary table with columns:
     - **Index**, **Title**, **Author**, **Journal**, **DOI**, **Objectives**, **Study Type**, **Data Type**, **Model Architecture**, **Metrics**, **Conclusion**.
   - Saves the document with a timestamped filename.

#### `helper.py`

This helper file supports the main script with functions for data retrieval and filtering:

1. **Blacklisted Journals**:
   - Excludes research articles from lower-impact journals by defining a blacklist.

2. **`fetch_pubmed_data()`**:
   - Retrieves articles from PubMed by query, limiting results to a specified maximum number.
   - Parses article details (e.g., PubMed ID, title, authors, journal) in MEDLINE format.

3. **`pubmed_parser()`**:
   - Filters articles against the journal blacklist.
   - Extracts details like PubMed ID, authors, title, journal, year, DOI, and abstract from each article.
   - Saves the parsed data to `parser_output.xlsx` for further processing in `process_research_papers.py`.

## Requirements

Install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install openai pandas python-docx tqdm biopython
```

**Set the OpenAI API Key** as an environment variable:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-dental-ai-abstract-processor.git
   cd automated-dental-ai-abstract-processor
   ```

2. **Customize Search Parameters**:
   - Modify the `time_interval` and `search_query` in `process_research_papers.py` for the desired date range and topic.

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python process_research_papers.py
   ```

4. **Output**:
   - A Word document will be saved with a filename like `DentalAIarticles_summary_2024-10-15-to-2024-10-31_gpt-4o-mini.docx`, containing a table with structured data for each research paper.

## Customization

- **Adjust Date Range**: Modify the `time_interval` variable to retrieve articles for a specific date range.
- **Change GPT Model**: Update the `gpt_model` variable in `process_research_papers.py` to use different OpenAI models.
- **Add/Remove Columns**: Edit the `processed_data` dictionary in the main script to adjust columns in the output file.
